<p>I&#39;ve only been working in the tech industry for a couple years now and I&#39;m starting to notice that people (and companies) have a very difficult time saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; (or &quot;no&quot;, &quot;we can&#39;t&quot;, etc).&#0160; Why is this?&#0160; There&#39;s nothing wrong with not knowing something, as long as you have the skills and abilities to figure it out. </p><p>I was at a local BarCamp meetup a little while back and one the people there was talking about finding jobs.&#0160; At one point he said to never say you can&#39;t do something in a job interview or else you wont get the job.&#0160; I was baffled.&#0160; If you can&#39;t do something, why would you say you can?&#0160; At some point the truth is going to come out anyways.&#0160; Is this really what it&#39;s come down to?&#0160; A better question, do managers expect this when doing interviews?&#0160; Do they expect people to say they can do anything even though they can&#39;t?&#0160; I really don&#39;t know, but this kind of scares me.</p><p>I have a couple friends from Europe and they&#39;re just as confused by this behavior as I am.&#0160; Apparently they don&#39;t have a problem with this, if you have something on your resume you bloody well know how to do it, if you can&#39;t do something they expect you to say so.</p><p>And really, what is the problem with hiring someone that might not know every detail of everything the position requires?&#0160; If I were hiring someone I&#39;d mainly be interested in their general problem solving and critical thinking skills.&#0160; Sure, you would need to have the basic skills for the job, but as long as it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re smart and interesting in learning what you don&#39;t know what&#39;s the difference?&#0160; I&#39;ll take that over someone who doesn&#39;t care about the job and is just there for a paycheck any day.</p><p>What have your experiences been, have you noticed the same things?&#0160; Do you say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; enough?&#0160; Leave it in the comments.<br /><em><br />&quot;We need to accept our ignorance and say &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39; more often&quot; </em>- Malcolm Gladwell, Blink</p>
