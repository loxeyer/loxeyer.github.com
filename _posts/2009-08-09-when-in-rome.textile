<p>My wife and I got back from our vacation in Rome, Italy a couple of weeks ago and I've got to say it was pretty amazing. This is defiantly one of those trips that everyone should take at least once in their lives. We did just about all the touristy things you can in Ancient Rome and then some; "Trevi Fountain":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/3795143692/, "Colosseum":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/3795142836/, "Spanish Steps":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/3795146466/, "Pantheon":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/3795151270/, "The Vatican":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/3795144506/ and "more":http://www.flickr.com/photos/27269999@N05/sets/72157621833186323/. It's amazing seeing some of this architecture that is still standing after thousands of years, it really puts some things into perspective.</p>

<p>Since I think everyone should visit Rome sometime I thought it might be a good idea to post some tips and suggestions that might help others with a similar trip.  If anyone else has tips/suggestions for travelers please leave them in the comments.</p>

<h3>10 Tips for your Trip to Rome</h3>
<ol>
  <li>*Stay in a central location* - We stayed at the "Cosmopolita Hotel":http://www.hotel-cosmopolita.com/hc/inglese/hotel.htm which was right in the center of Ancient Rome and it was the perfect distance from everything we wanted to see.</li>
  <li>*Find a nearby grocery store* - We found Rome to be very expensive so finding a grocery store where we could load of on water, snacks and a couple of bottles of wine really helped out</li>
  <li>*Do your own tours* - Paying for a guide is nice for some attractions, but there's all kinds of tour books that will do almost as good a job.  We found <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0470287829?ie=UTF8&tag=jodusbl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0470287829">Frommer's Rome</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=jodusbl-20&l=as2&o=15&a=0470287829" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> was full of useful information and history.</li>
  <li>*Get off the beaten track* - Take some time to check out the city and some of the less well known attractions. <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0470228989?ie=UTF8&tag=jodusbl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0470228989">Frommer's 24 Great Walks in Rome</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=jodusbl-20&l=as2&o=15&a=0470228989" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> brings you to a number of interesting areas in Rome that you would never have seen otherwise.</li>
  <li>*Choose a Hotel that includes breakfast* - Again, Rome is really expensive so having a hotel that includes breakfast means you can spens your money on delicious pasta and wine for dinner.</li>
  <li>*Make use of local transit* - The transit system in Rome is quite good and very inexpensive so take advantage of it when travelling to The Vatican or to get out of the main tourist areas.</li>
  <li>*Don't overdo your stay* - There is a lot to see in Rome, but most of it is concentrated in fairly small area. If you stay for 3-5 days that would be more than enough time to see everything. Use any extra time to check out Florence or Venice.</li>
  <li>*Remember pants and long sleeves* - A lot of the churches don't want you wearing shorts or women having their shoulders uncovered. Rome is hot, but remember to bring some long pants and for women a light shawl.</li>
  <li>*Make use of the public water fountains* - There are fountains all over Ancient Rome running with cold, drinkable water perfect for when you're hot and thirsty.</li>
  <li>*Know the street signs* - Being from North America I was very used to metal sign posts with the street names; it took a little while to figure out that the stone plaques on the sides of buildings were actually street signs. Once you figure this out it's pretty easy to find your way walking through Rome.</li>

<p>One more bonus tip, bring a couple extra memory cards for your digital camera, it's almost impossible to to take a bad picture in Rome so you will fill it up (we took ~1200 pictures!).</p>

<p>I hope you find these tips useful for your trip, make sure you have fun!</p>
