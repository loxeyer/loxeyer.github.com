<p>The markets are going crazy with ups and downs (mostly downs), governments are bailing out their banking systems and countries with a sound banking system are still needing huge cash injections to keep things rolling.&#0160; Things are getting pretty bad.&#0160; They&#39;re likely to get worse.&#0160; Is there an upside to the economic troubles we&#39;re having?&#0160; I&#39;d say yes.</p><p>We&#39;re already starting to see some of the benefits; the most obvious being the price of gas.&#0160; In one day I saw the price drop from $1.30 / L to around $1.00 in my area.&#0160; This is a pretty huge change and the savings will help people in a big way through these tough times.&#0160; My hope is that this is just the start, other goods and services will be feeling the crunch as people cut back on high end goods for a while, this should lead to lower prices as they try and spur sales.</p><p>I also think the startup world is going to benefit from the turn in the economy.&#0160; Sure, companies are going to go out of business, people will be laid off and things will be pretty tough in general but something had to happen.&#0160; If you take a look at the money that&#39;s been tossed around the last few years it&#39;s kind of ridiculous the valuations and ideas that have gained funding.&#0160; Is there anyone out there willing to give Facebook a $15 billion valuation anymore?&#0160; I sure hope not.&#0160; Then there&#39;s a all the copycats and really silly ideas that have been coming out lately, some even getting funding.&#0160; All of this is making it really hard to see the interesting, innovative companies through all the crap that&#39;s out there.</p><p>Another interesting thing that&#39;s going to start happening is mergers and acquisitions.&#0160; Startups with some really interesting ideas and technologies will become more appealing to the big guys as prices drop.&#0160; This might not be quite as good for the startup themselves, but many of them could really benefit from being in a larger organization which would help them in the long run.&#0160; Larger companies are also going to have to streamline their organizations, cut costs and improve profits in a tough market.&#0160; Again, this is hard on the people involved, but when things turn around and the market improves these companies will be leaner and more profitable, able to create a whole slew of new jobs.</p><p>In the sort term things are going to be tough, that&#39;s just a fact, but hopefully there will be some good in these trying times.</p><p><em>[Disclosure] I am not an economist, financial planner or anything like that.&#0160; I&#39;m just stating the way I see things, the right or wrong of it I&#39;ll leave up to you.</em></p>
