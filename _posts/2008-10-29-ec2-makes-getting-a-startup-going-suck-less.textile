<p>Obviously getting your startup going doesn&#39;t suck (well, hopefully not all the time), but it is a shit load of work.&#0160; You need a kick ass idea, people to build it, a way to distribute, somehow get people to pay for what you&#39;re doing and countless other tasks.&#0160; This is a lot to deal with, and since you&#39;re a startup it&#39;s probably you or a small team doing all the work.&#0160; Well, if you happen to be building a web based product <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazons EC2</a> platform is defiantly something to check out.</p><p>EC2 is Amazons &#39;Elastic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a>&#39; platform and it lets you take advantage of Amazons huge server and computing infrastructure to run your own server instances.&#0160; There are countless advantages to running your application in the cloud like this, the big ones in my opinion are cost savings as you <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing">pay for what you use</a>, flexibility in expanding your server farm and the reliability of a distributed and proven network.</p><p>This is really cool.&#0160; If you think back to a couple of years ago how you would setup your own infrastructure you&#39;d need to go out and buy some expensive servers and load balances, get it all setup somewhere&#0160; and then hope the traffic doesn&#39;t blow up the machines before you can get get more in to handle the load.&#0160; Now with EC2 you don&#39;t need to worry about the hardware and over purchasing to handle the load or running out and buying a new machine when one gets fried.</p><p>Things with EC2 aren&#39;t quite perfect yet, but they&#39;re not far off and a lot of the pain points are going to be addressed in the near future (2009) Amazon says.&#0160; From the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/10/big-day-for-ec2.html">Amazon Web Services blog</a>, here&#39;s a couple of the things to look forward to:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Management Console</strong> - The management console will simplify the process of configuring and operating your applications in the AWS cloud. You&#39;ll be able to get a global picture of your cloud computing environment using a point-and-click web interface.<br /><strong>Load Balancing</strong> - The load balancing service will allow you to balance incoming requests and traffic across multiple EC2 instances.<br /><strong>Automatic Scaling</strong> - The auto-scaling service will allow you to grow and shrink your usage of EC2 capacity on demand based on application requirements.<br /><strong>Cloud Monitoring</strong> - The cloud monitoring service will provide real time, multi-dimensional monitoring of host resources across any number of EC2 instances, with the ability to aggregate operational metrics across instances, Availability Zones, and time slots.<br /></em></div><p><br />Awesomesauce.&#0160; Those are the exact things that have been creating extra work when using their current offering, Amazon is spot on with the features that their users are really looking for.</p><p>I really like what Amazon is doing in this space, but if you don&#39;t or if it doesn&#39;t do what you need it to there are alternatives.&#0160; <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine (GAE)</a> is one such alternative that looks pretty neat.&#0160; It&#39;s neat because it&#39;s built by google, on top of their infrastructure and allows easy integration with existing google services (docs, accounts, etc).&#0160; In it&#39;s current state it&#39;s nothing compared to EC2.&#0160; </p><p>The biggest difference is that with GAE you&#39;re tied to using python for your application development and you can&#39;t really customize the platform at all.&#0160; With EC2 you start with a basic linux (and now windows) that you can then customize with whatever you want.&#0160; But if you don&#39;t want to do all that work, and you&#39;re a python kind of person, GAE might be perfect for you.&#0160; I, on the other hand, prefer the flexibility you get with EC2 and can&#39;t wait to see where they go from here.</p><p>Go out, <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/">get started</a>.</p>
