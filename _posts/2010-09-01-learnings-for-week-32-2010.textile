I'm a little light on the learnings this week so you might also want to check out the "learnings from the rest of the Rubinauts":http://blog.rubinauts.com/?p=140. We're talking Mobile APIs, Rails 3 and content_for, trixbox and more in this one.

* In Mail.app if you want to organize your mail messages in threads: View -> Organize by Thread

* Removing a git submodule is a little trickier than adding one, found some detailed instructions <a href="http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/">here</a>. It boils down to the following:

# Remove the submodule's entry in the .gitmodules file
# Remove the submodule's entry in .git/config
# Remove the path created for the submodule (do not put a trailing slash on the path){% highlight bash %}
git rm --cached [plugin path]
{% endhighlight %}
