Just a few little tidbits this week, more on the "Rubinauts blog":http://blog.rubinauts.com/?p=167.

* To stop annoying your coworkers when the volume is up on your mac go to Terminal Prefs > advanced  and turn on Visual Bell instead of Audible Bell. There will be many high fives from the people in your immediate work area.

* <a href='http://echoone.com/doubletake/'>DoubleTake</a> is a neat little program for OS X to stitch photos together.

* To get history in IRB add these lines to ~/.irbc{% highlight ruby %}
require 'irb/ext/save-history'
#History configuration
IRB.conf[:SAVE_HISTORY] = 100
IRB.conf[:HISTORY_FILE] = "#{ENV['HOME']}/.irb-save-history"
{% endhighlight %}

* <a href='http://www.gotapi.com/rubyrails'>gotapi.com</a> recently switched the Rails documentation to Rails 3.0. If you need Rails and Ruby documentation from other versions <a href='http://railsapi.com/'>railsapi.com</a> is where it's at. You can build your own custom package of Rails and Ruby docs back to Rails 2.2.2 and either browse online or download a copy for your nightstand.
