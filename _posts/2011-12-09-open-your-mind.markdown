As a computer programmar,he should understand how share knowledge,and warn himself open share mind now and forever.

A GRE issue question:

Students should bring a certain skepticism to whatever they study. They should question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.

yeap, i am a students until my life over.do you agree my point?
