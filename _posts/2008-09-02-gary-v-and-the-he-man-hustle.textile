The other day I was sent a link to one of <a title="Gary Vaynerchuk Wikipedia Entry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Vaynerchuk">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>'s <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">video blog</a> entries and have since watched a number of his <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/2008/08/21/you-can-have-bothjobs/">other</a> <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/2008/08/05/content-and-community-how-to-build-a-good-show-on-the-internet/">posts</a> and subscribed to his <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GaryVaynerchuk">feed</a>.&nbsp; If you're in business, marketing, a startup or breathing you should get your ass over to his site and check out some of his videos.  I'm sure that no matter who you are you'll find something of interest.&nbsp; Below is a personal favorite, <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/2008/08/12/better-than-zero/">Better than Zero</a>.<br><br><center>

<br><br>He might come off a little rough around the edges, but he defiantly knows what he's talking about.&nbsp; Really looking forward to more of his videos.
