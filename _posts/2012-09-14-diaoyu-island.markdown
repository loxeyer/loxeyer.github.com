"purchaseing of Diaoyu island" on Sep 12th 2012 due to that numerous individuls which include me of China became extremely angry.But in the meantime,whether the use of force has sparked much debate.some people assert the event is less significant than harmony of economical and political.while many others argue that it is time to display chinese power.Personally i am in favor of the former view. 

Convincing arguments can be made that military combat is better.firstly,we need enough preparation to win the Diaoyu war.Therefor not only the navy should go the island but also the air force must be following.secondly,India,Philippines etc.cannot disturb our rare door, which will part of our attention and mind.Lastly,inner party struggle must stop,for instance,we must forget Bo and wang event.in other words, to hold everyone's hand is the key of point to win the war.

Admittedly.the war will be damage the construction of economics.we will pay much of money,energe,material, and many soldier will be die.Obviously,more a loss than gain.Even so,to get dignity is more important than to be die which for preserving territory.

In summary, even though keeping development of economics speed up stably is less important that protecting our land resource.Overall if our force would control the Diaoyu island, I am convinced i will pay my sallary of half for supporting our country.
