<p>I&#39;ve started playing around with Adobe Air and Flex 3 again, man is it annoying sometimes.&#160; I&#39;ve been programming Ruby for awhile now and really like it so maybe it&#39;s affecting how I look at other languages, but I&#39;m starting to notice how convoluted and confusing things seem to be in other languages.&#160; The thing that annoys me around every corner with Flex (and ActionScript 3) is how heavily the rely on events.&#160; I understand the event pattern and how useful events can be, but most Flex code I look at gets very confusing trying to follow all the events jumping around.&#160; Everything happens with events and listeners; click, mouse move, service calls, image loaders, url loaders... </p><p>Why does everything need to happen based on events?&#160; Why can&#39;t some things, like service calls, block until they get a response instead of fire and forget?&#160; It would make a little more sense if flash was multi-threaded but it isn&#39;t, so if something else starts happening and holding the runtime up it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re event gets fired.&#160; Maybe this is just me, but following from method call, to handler, to another handler because the last one threw another event is really annoying.</p><p>Well, now that I got that rant out of the way I&#39;ll start digging in and trying to fit in with the Flex event based ways.</p>
