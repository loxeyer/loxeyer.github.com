<p>I&#39;m really looking forward to leaving tomorrow afternoon for Orlando Florida to attend <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2008</a>, it should be a blast.&#0160; The hotel looks amazing, the weather is going to be great, what more can you ask for?&#0160; Oh ya, there is more, some great talks and presentations from Rubyists around the world!</p><p>There are a number of interesting presentations, but a a couple of them really stand out.&#0160; One presentation that I&#39;m really looking forward to is &#39;<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/18">Recovering from Enterprise: how to embrace Ruby&#39;s idioms and say goodbye to bad habits</a>&#39; by Jamis Buck of <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>.&#0160; I really respect the guys at 37, they have a no bullshit way of saying things that <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php">just make sense</a>, I like that.&#0160; Jamis is also a long time Rubyist and has given so much to the community with the projects he&#39;s worked on (capistrano, sqllite ruby bindings), and has been teasing us with <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1340-embrace-real-constraints-not-artificial-ones">interesting blog posts</a> related to his presentation.</p><p><br />I&#39;m also interested in the talk Scott Chacon is giving, &#39;<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/8">Using Git in Ruby Applications</a>&#39; mainly because I find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a> to be such an in interesting source control system (and maybe I can pull some of my co-workers along so Scott can infect them with the Git as well).&#0160; It sounds like Scott is going to be getting into some very interesting things with his presentation as well, such as using git as the backend for a ruby based wiki or file backup system.&#0160; Cool stuff.</p><p>On Friday I&#39;m probably going to try and catch Yehuda Katz presentation, &#39;<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/51">Writing Code That Doesn&#39;t Suck: Interface P=Oriented Design</a>&#39; since, if you&#39;ve read any of my <a href="/2008/09/24/make-it-suck-less/">other</a> <a href="/2008/10/29/ec2-makes-getting-a-startup-going-suck-less/">blog</a> <a href="/2008/10/21/making-input-fields-suck-less/">posts</a>, I really like to do as much as possible to make things suck less.&#0160; I&#39;m not all that interested in Merb though so I may wander over to &#39;<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/50">Ruby Heavy-Lifting: Lazy load it, Event it, Defer it, and then Optimize it.</a>&#39; by Ilya Griorik and see what he has to say beacause, really, can you every know enough about making you code and application run faster?&#0160; Didn&#39;t think so.</p><p>Anyways, that&#39;s just a short run down on some of the great presentations that are going to be happening this weekend.&#0160; There will also be appearances by Matz (the creator of Ruby) and Dave Thomas (Pragmatic Programmers), both are likely to have something interesting to say.</p><p>See you in Orlando!</p>
