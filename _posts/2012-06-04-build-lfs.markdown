###The primary target architecture of LFS is the 32-bit Intel CPU.
The computer bit commond is arch or uname -a 

###Standards
The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as possible. The primary standards are:

#### POSIX.1-2008.

POSIX 表示可移植操作系统接口（Portable Operating System Interface ，缩写为 POSIX 是为了读音更像 UNIX）

#### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

规范在根目录(/)及子目录(/usr, /var)下面各个主要目录应该放什么样的文件

#### Linux Standard Base (LSB) Core Specification 4.0

The LSB has five separate standards: Core, C++, Desktop, Runtime Languages, and Printing. 


###Before building an LFS system, we recommend reading the following HOWTOs:

• Software-Building-HOWTO http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html

This is a comprehensive guide to building and installing “generic” Unix software packages under Linux.
Although it was written some time ago, it still provides a good summary of the basic techniques needed to build
and install software.

• The Essential Pre-Reading Hint http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/essential_prereading.txt

This is an LFS Hint written specifically for users new to Linux. It includes a list of links to excellent sources of
information on a wide range of topics. Anyone attempting to install LFS should have an understanding of many
of the topics in this hint.
