<p>This past week saw something we&#39;ve seem <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/">before</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/12/11/bebo-platform/">again</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/04/myspace-developer-platform-launches/">again</a>, with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> launching it&#39;s <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/10/28/announcing-applications-on-linkedin/">application platform</a>.&#0160; The big question is why, what&#39;s the point?&#0160; Their team is pushing it as professional applications for things like sharing book reviews, documents, and extended communication options.</p><p>Okay, that&#39;s cool, but most of the people you generally connect with on Linkedin are professional peers, if you had a need for this you&#39;re probably already doing it with something like IM or google docs.&#0160; Since Linkedin is a professional network it doesn&#39;t really lend itself to the type of viral <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9727759-2.html">sheep throwing applications</a> that made the Facebook platform so popular.</p><p>Now, the thing I&#39;m really wondering is why it took them almost a year from <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2007/12/10/the-intelligent-2/">announcing the platform</a> (about 5 months after the Facebook platform took off) and actually <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2008/10/28/announcing-applications-on-linkedin/">releasing it</a>.&#0160; To me it seems like the first post on their platform was a load of crap and they were just trying to grab onto a bit of the hype that Facebook had generated.&#0160; On top of this almost every application I tried to use gave me some sort of error or had information flowing outside of the visible area for the application.&#0160; I expect more from such a <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/linkedin">high profile company</a> with over a year of development time.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t make Linkedin suck less, if anything it makes them suck more because it seems like all their doing is running after the successful ideas from other companies.&#0160; If it doesn&#39;t make it suck less, don&#39;t do it.</p>
